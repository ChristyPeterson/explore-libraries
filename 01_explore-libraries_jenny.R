# Above is the yml information which is telling the compile notebook to make a github doc

# CP editted version of Jenny's file as I lost my version when R crashed

# Libraries ####
library(fs)
library(tidyverse)

# Code ####
#' Which libraries does R search for packages?
.libPaths()

## let's confirm the second element is, in fact, the default library
.Library
path_real(.Library)

#' Installed packages
ipt <- installed.packages() %>%
  as_tibble()

## how many packages?
nrow(ipt)

#' Exploring the packages

## count some things! inspiration
##   * tabulate by LibPath, Priority, or both
ipt %>%
  count(LibPath, Priority)

##   * what proportion need compilation?
ipt %>%
  count(NeedsCompilation) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

##   * how break down re: version of R they were built on
ipt %>%
  count(Built) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

#' Reflections

## reflect on ^^ and make a few notes to yourself; inspiration
##   * does the number of base + recommended packages make sense to you?
##   * how does the result of .libPaths() relate to the result of .Library?


#' Going further

## if you have time to do more ...

## is every package in .Library either base or recommended?
all_default_pkgs <- list.files(.Library)
all_br_pkgs <- ipt %>%
  filter(Priority %in% c("base", "recommended")) %>%
  pull(Package)
setdiff(all_default_pkgs, all_br_pkgs)

## study package naming style (all lower case, contains '.', etc

## use `fields` argument to installed.packages() to get more info and use it!
ipt2 <- installed.packages(fields = "URL") %>%
  as_tibble()
ipt2 %>%
  mutate(github = grepl("github", URL)) %>%
  count(github) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
